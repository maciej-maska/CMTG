  abstract = {Recently, the learning by confusion (LbC) approach has been proposed as a machine learning tool to determine 
  the critical temperature T<sub>c</sub> of phase transitions without any prior knowledge of its even approximate value. 
  The method has been proven effective, but it has been used only for continuous phase transitions, where the confusion results 
  only from deliberate incorrect labeling of the data. However, in the case of a discontinuous phase transition, additional 
  confusion can result from the coexistence of different phases. To verify whether the confusion scheme can also be used for 
  discontinuous phase transitions, we apply the LbC method to three microscopic models, the Blume-Capel, the q-state Potts, 
  and the Falicov-Kimball models, which undergo continuous or discontinuous phase transitions depending on model parameters. 
  With the help of a simple model, we predict that the phase coexistence present in discontinuous phase transitions can indeed 
  make the neural network more confused and thus decrease its performance. However, numerical calculations performed for the 
  models mentioned above indicate that other aspects of this kind of phase transition are more important and can render the 
  LbC method even less effective. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that in some cases the same aspects allow us to use the LbC 
  method to identify the order of a phase transition.}

Y<sub>5</sub>Rh<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>18</sub> compound indicate intriguing coexistence of the high temperature thermal lattice

T<sub>c</sub>=3.08 K. Y<sub>5</sub>Rh<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>18</sub>, having a cage-like structure crystallises in tetragonal 
structure with the space group I41/acd. The gap structure of this compound is found not to be characteristic of conventional 
BCS type superconductors. Anomalous behaviour observed in the electronic specific heat C(T)/T and the upper critical field 
H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data may suggest the presence of two superconducting gaps in this compound. The ab initio band structure 
calculations showed a significant contribution of s and p Sn states as well as Rh and Y d-electron states to the total density 
of states near the Fermi level, which supports the multi-band superconductivity of this compound. Several electronic quantities 
and parameters characterising the superconducting and normal state of Y<sub>5</sub>Rh<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>18</sub> are calculated 
within the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov theory. The data reveals dirty limit superconductivity in

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
