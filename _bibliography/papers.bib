  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2401.12218},
  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the structurally ordered Fe2VAl Heusler alloy is nonmagnetic narrow-gap semiconductor. This compound is apt to form various disordered modifications with high concentration of antisite defects. We study the effect of structural disorder on the electronic structure, magnetic, and electronic transport properties of the full Heusler alloy Fe2VAl and its off-stoichiometric equivalent Fe2VAl1.35. Data analysis in relation to {\it ab initio} calculations indicates an appearance of antisite disorder mainly due to Fe--V and Fe--Al stoichiometric variations. The data for weakly magnetic Fe2VAl1.35 are discussed in respect to Ni2VAl. Fe2VAl1.35 can be classified as a nearly ferromagnetic metal with a pronounced spin glassy contribution, which, however, does not give a predominant effect on its thermoelectric properties. The figure of merit ZT is at 300 K about 0.05 for the Fe sample and 0.02 for Ni one, respectively. However, it is documented that the narrow d band resulting from Fe/V site exchange can be responsible for the unusual temperature dependencies of the physical properties of the Fe2TiAl1.35 alloy, characteristic of strongly correlated electron systems. As an example, the magnetic susceptibility of Fe2VAl1.35 exhibits singularity characteristic of a Griffiths phase, appearing as an inhomogeneous electronic state below TG∼200 K. We also performed numerical analysis which supports the Griffiths phase scenario.},

  title = {Autoencoder-Based Analytic Continuation Method for Strongly Correlated Quantum Systems},
  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2311.17920},
  abstract = {The single particle Green's function provides valuable information on the momentum and energy-resolved spectral properties for a strongly correlated system. In large-scale numerical calculations using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), including cluster-DMFT, one usually obtains the Green's function in imaginary-time \(G(\tau)\). The process of inverting a Laplace transform to obtain the spectral function \(A(\omega)\)\ in real-frequency is an ill-posed problem and forms the core of the analytic continuation problem. In this Letter, we propose to use a completely unsupervised autoencoder-type neural network to solve the analytic continuation problem. We introduce an encoder-decoder approach that, together with only minor physical assumptions, can extract a high-quality frequency response from the imaginary time domain. With a deeply tunable architecture, this method can, in principle, locate sharp features of spectral functions that might normally be lost using already well-established methods, such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods. We demonstrate the strength of the autoencoder approach by applying it to QMC results of \(G(\tau)\)\ for a single-band Hubbard model. The proposed method is general and can also be applied to other ill-posed inverse problems.},

  abstract = {Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains are paradigmatic examples of one-dimensional topological insulators hosting zero-energy edge modes when the bulk of the system has a nonzero topological winding invariant. Recently, high-harmonic spectroscopy has been suggested as a tool for detecting the topological phase. Specifically, it has been shown that when the SSH chain is coupled to an external laser field of a frequency much smaller than the band gap, the emitted light at harmonic frequencies strongly differs between the trivial and the topological phase. However, it remains unclear whether various nontrivial topological phases—differing in the number of edge states—can also be distinguished by the high-harmonic generation (HHG). In this paper, we investigate this problem by studying an extended version of the SSH chain with extended-range hoppings, resulting in a topological model with different topological phases. We explicitly show that HHG spectra are a sensitive and suitable tool for distinguishing topological phases when there is more than one topological phase. We also propose a quantitative scheme based on tuning the filling of the system to precisely locate the number of edge modes in each topological phase of this chain.},

  abstract = {We build a machine learning model to detect correlations in a three-qubit system using a neural network trained in an unsupervised manner on randomly generated states. The network is forced to recognize separable states, and correlated states are detected as anomalies. Quite surprisingly, we find that the proposed detector performs much better at distinguishing a weaker form of quantum correlations, namely, the quantum discord, than entanglement. In fact, it has a tendency to grossly overestimate the set of entangled states even at the optimal threshold for entanglement detection, while it underestimates the set of discordant states to a much lesser extent. In order to illustrate the nature of states classified as quantum-correlated, we construct a diagram containing various types of states -- entangled, as well as separable, both discordant and non-discordant. We find that the near-zero value of the recognition loss reproduces the shape of the non-discordant separable states with high accuracy, especially considering the non-trivial shape of this set on the diagram. The network architecture is designed carefully: it preserves separability, and its output is equivariant with respect to qubit permutations. We show that the choice of architecture is important to get the highest detection accuracy, much better than for a baseline model that just utilizes a partial trace operation.},

  abstract = {Quasicrystals are fascinating and important because of their unconventional atomic arrangements, which challenge traditional notions of crystalline structures. Unlike regular crystals, they lack translational symmetry and generate unique mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, holding promise for numerous applications. In order to probe the electronic properties of quasicrystals, tools beyond linear response transport measurements are needed, since all spectral regions can be affected by the non-periodic geometry. Here we show that high-harmonic spectroscopy offers an advanced avenue for this goal. Focusing on the quasiperiodic 1D Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, we leverage high-harmonic spectroscopy to delve into their intricate characteristics: By carefully analyzing emitted harmonic intensities, we extract the multifractal spectrum -- an essential indicator of the spatial distribution of electronic states in quasicrystals. Additionally, we address the detection of mobility edges, vital energy thresholds that demarcate localized and extended eigenstates within generalized AAH models. The precise identification of these mobility edges sheds light on the metal-insulator transition and the behavior of electronic states near these boundaries. Merging high-harmonic spectroscopy with the AAH model provides a powerful framework for understanding the interplay between localization and extended states in quasicrystals for an extremely wide energy range not captured within linear response studies, thereby offering valuable insights for guiding future experimental investigations.},

  abstract = {Recently, the learning by confusion (LbC) approach has been proposed as a machine learning tool to determine 
  the critical temperature \(T_c\)\ of phase transitions without any prior knowledge of its even approximate value. 
  The method has been proven effective, but it has been used only for continuous phase transitions, where the confusion results 
  only from deliberate incorrect labeling of the data. However, in the case of a discontinuous phase transition, additional 
  confusion can result from the coexistence of different phases. To verify whether the confusion scheme can also be used for 
  discontinuous phase transitions, we apply the LbC method to three microscopic models, the Blume-Capel, the q-state Potts, 
  and the Falicov-Kimball models, which undergo continuous or discontinuous phase transitions depending on model parameters. 
  With the help of a simple model, we predict that the phase coexistence present in discontinuous phase transitions can indeed 
  make the neural network more confused and thus decrease its performance. However, numerical calculations performed for the 
  models mentioned above indicate that other aspects of this kind of phase transition are more important and can render the 
  LbC method even less effective. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that in some cases the same aspects allow us to use the LbC 
  method to identify the order of a phase transition.},

  disorder on the coherence length scale ξ additionally generates a nonhomogeneous, high-temperature superconducting phase with 
  disorder-enhanced critical temperature \(T^*_c\). We have previously discussed various possibilities of local atomic disorder; one of 
  the possibilities is doping. Our present studies focus on the series of <nobr>Y\(_\{5-\delta\}\)(Rh\(_\{5.5\}\)M\(_\{0.5\}\))Sn\(_\{18\}\)</nobr>  compounds (δ≪1), where the dopants 
  M = Co, Ir, Ru, and Pd, when they are smaller (Co) or larger (Pd) than Rh, generate the peak effect in fields smaller than the 
  critical field \(H_\{c2\}\). This phenomenon manifests itself as a weak peak in the real and imaginary parts of ac susceptibility and is more 
  distinct in magnetoresistance. Using a simple theoretical model, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of this mechanism depends not 
  only on the magnitude of the difference between the size of the dopant and the host atom, but also on whether the dopant is smaller 
  or larger. The agreement between this prediction and our experimental data strongly supports the impurity-based scenario of the 
  observed peak effect. Magnetoresistance isotherms of the remaining samples (M = Ir and Ru) with the radius of M being very similar 
  to that of Rh show, however, a weak peak-effect-like behavior, which is mainly due to vacancies δ at Y sites, while the corresponding 
  ac susceptibility isotherms exhibit a distinct peak at \(H\sim H_\{c2\}\). This field-dependent χac anomaly appears to be similar in nature to the 
  peak effect; however, it cannot be attributed to pinning and appears to be an equilibrium property of the system. We also report the

We demonstrate that an unconventional topological phase transition with neither gap closing nor a change of symmetry is possible. We consider a nanoscopic length ladder of atoms on a superconducting substrate, comprising self-organized magnetic moments coupled to itinerant electrons. For a range of conditions, the ground state of such a system prefers helical magnetic textures, a self-sustaining topologically nontrivial phase. Abrupt changes in the magnetic order as a function of induced superconducting pairing or chemical potential can cause topological phase transitions without closing the topological gap. Furthermore, the ground state prefers either parallel or antiparallel configurations along the rungs, and the antiparallel configuration causes an emergent time reversal asymmetry protecting Kramers pairs of Majorana zero modes, but in a BDI topological superconductor. We determine the topological invariant and inspect the boundary Majorana zero modes.},

We have shown that the disorder on the coherence length scale &xi; in these nonmagnetic quasiskutterudite superconductors additionally generates a non-homogeneous, high-temperature superconducting phase with Tc⋆&gt;Tc (dilute disorder scenario), while the strong fluctuations of stoichiometry due to increasing doping can rapidly increase the superconducting transition temperature of the sample even to the value of Tc⋆&sim;2Tc (dense disorder leading to strong inhomogeneity). This phenomenon seems to be characteristic of high-temperature superconductors and superconducting heavy fermions, and recently have received renewed attention. We experimentally documented the stronger lattice stiffening of the inhomogeneous superconducting phase Tc⋆ in respect to the bulk Tc one and proposed a model that explains the Tc⋆&gt;Tc behavior in the series of nonmagnetic skutterudite-related compounds.},

  abstract = {Performing Monte Carlo simulations, we study the temperature-dependent self-organization of magnetic moments coupled to itinerant electrons in a finite-size one-dimensional nanostructure proximitized to a superconducting reservoir. At low temperatures, an effective interaction between the localized magnetic moments, that is mediated by itinerant electrons, leads to their helical ordering. This ordering, in turn, affects the itinerant electrons, inducing the topologically nontrivial superconducting phase that hosts the Majorana modes. In a wide range of system parameters, the spatial periodicity of a spiral order that minimizes the ground-state energy turns out to promote the topological phase. We determine the correlation length of such spiral order and study how it is reduced by thermal fluctuations. This reduction is accompanied by suppression of the topological gap (which separates the zero-energy mode from continuum), setting the upper (critical) temperature for the existence of the Majorana quasiparticles. Monte Carlo simulations do not rely on any ansatz for configurations of the localized moments, therefore, they can be performed for arbitrary model parameters, also beyond the perturbative regime.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been substantial progress in methods of identifying local integrals of motion in interacting integrable models or in systems with many-body localization. We show that one of these approaches can be utilized for constructing local, conserved, Majorana fermions in systems with an arbitrary many-body interaction. As a test case, we first investigate a noninteracting Kitaev model and demonstrate that this approach perfectly reproduces the standard results. Then, we discuss how the many-body interactions influence the spatial structure and the lifetime of the Majorana modes. Finally, we determine the regime for which the information stored in the Majorana correlators is also retained for arbitrarily long times at high temperatures. We show that it is included in the regime with topologically protected soft Majorana modes, but in some cases is significantly smaller.},

Therefore, it is difficult to determine the critical temperature in a precise way. In this paper we demonstrate how neural networks can be used to perform this task. In particular, we study how the accuracy of the transition identification depends on the way the neural networks are trained. We apply our approach to three different systems: (i) the classical XY model, (ii) the phase-fermion model, where classical and quantum degrees of freedom are coupled and (iii) the quantum XY model.},
